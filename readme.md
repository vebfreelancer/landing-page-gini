```
The task consisted of two stages. The first step was to convert the Figma design into  
Responsive HTML. At the client's request, the adaptation for mobile screens was implemented  
on the Bootstrap framework. The next stage was working on the pop-up animation.  
On my recommendation, I added animations for buttons and lines in the steps section to  
attract users' attention.
